    <string name="long_winded_rules">Pinochle is a fun, exciting, competitive game for four players, 2 players to a team. The deck is made up of 48 cards (12 spades, 12 diamonds, 12 hearts, and 12 clubs). There are six possible ranks of cards: nine, ten, jack, queen, and king. For each rank and suit, there are two cards of that combination in the deck to make 48 cards(meaning there are two kings of spades, two nines of hearts, etc.) Each player is dealt 12 of these cards to start the game. \n The game then moves through three phases: the bidding phase, the passing phase, and the playing cards phase. \n \n <u>The Bidding Phase</u> \n \n The bidding phase starts with the player to the left of the dealer making either the minimum bid or higher should they see fit. Bidding must go up by at least one point (or point increment if changed in the settings). If a player doesn\'t wish to bid that high, they may pass. The bidding phase ends when all but one players have passed. The bid winner will then declare a suit to be trump. The goal is to bid just enough to where your meld and pointers (more on that later) add up to your bid. If you bid less than or equal to your point total, you add your meld and pointer total to your score. If you bid more than your meld and pointer total, your team is set. You have the bid subtracted from your score. \n\n  <i>Variation: Shoot the Moon</i> \n\n An optional variation is to give players the choice to shoot the moon. After seeing the meld, if you believe that you can take EVERY pointer then you can declare shoot the moon. If you take every pointer your bid and 25 points (multiplied by the point increment in settings) plus your pointers and meld. If you do not take every pointer though you are set and lose your bid minus 25 points (times the value in the settings).This variation is off by default. \n\n <u>Passing Phase</u> \n\n In this phase players pass a limited amount of cards back and forth to try to help achieve the most meld possible. The amount of cards that can be passed back and forth is in the settings screen.  Whatever the setting you must pass exactly that many cards, no more and no less. Feel free to experiment and come up with your own strategies! \n\n <u>Meld Display</u> \n\nAfter the passing back and forth is complete and all players have 12 cards, meld is displayed for everyone to see. The game provides a certain amount of meld for each of the following (all values are multiplied by the pointer setting in settings): \n A run of trump (Ace,Ten,King,Queen, and Jack):15 meld \n King and Queen of trump: 4 meld. \n Note: If you have a run of trump you must have a second king,queen of trump combination in order to get 19 meld. \n A nine of trump gives a point of meld. \n An Ace of each suit: 10 meld\n A King of each suit: 8 meld \n A Queen of each suit: 6 meld \n A Jack of each suit: 4 meld\n Nines and Tens of each suit do not give meld. \n Submitting multiple copies of the above (except the marriage of trump and nines of trump) gives 10 times their point value. \n A King and Queen of the same suit (a marriage) that is not trump is 2 meld for every marriage. \n A pinochle is the Queen of Spades Jack of Diamonds. One of these is worth 4 meld. Two of these is worth 30 meld.\n \n All players are required to show any meld in their hands at the start of the game. \n After this display is complete, play continues to the card playing phase, with the bid winner leading the first trick.\n\n The person who won the trick (or bid winner if no tricks have been played that hand) will be able to lead the card of his/her/their choosing. The next player must play a card of that suit if they have it. Furthermore if they have a card of a higher rank, they must play that. In order, Ace beats Ten beats King beats Queen beats Jack beats Nine. If a player has no cards of the suit led but has trump they must play that. Furthermore if the trick has been trumped already and the bidding player has no cards of the suit led and trump, they must play a card of trump that they have that is of higher rank (if applicable). If a player has no cards led or trump, then they may play whatever they like but it will not win the trick. \n\n After all of the players have played a card for that trick, the trick is evaluated and the team that won the trick is given a certain number of pointers based on how many Aces, Tens, and Kings were in the hand. Each one of those three is worth one point. The tricks repeat in this manner until the last trick. After that trick is complete the winner of the final trick gets an additional pointer. \n\n\n After the tricks are completed the meld and pointers are added to see if the bidding team was successful as defined above. The non bidding team gets their meld and pointers if they got at least one pointer. (This is customizable in the settings.)\n\n\n\n Hands continue until a team has a high enough score (150 by default) to win the game. <i>Alternate variation: The Mercy Rule</i> \n\n Some people play with a rule that if a team is ahead by more than the score to win the game the team with more points wins. This is on by default.\n\n\n\n\n
        And the most important rule have fun!! </string>
